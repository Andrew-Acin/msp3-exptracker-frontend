I have made this front end as simple as i can.

I have created all pages of our app in the components folder and a Navbar connecting them all using routes in App.js

I did not add any folders for redux as Chris mentioned we don't need to and might be better if we avoid redux for tis project.

Hope we can use this to start with and make it look nicer once we get the functionality sorted in the backend repo - Andy
