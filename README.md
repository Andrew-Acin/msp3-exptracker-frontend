Our App has a Navbar at the top with working routes letting us click on each nav item giving us access to all pages in our App

Our Home page has some mock data giving us a bank account balance, below that we have a pie chart that is populated by data we have added via our routes.

Our ExpenseList is a list of all expenses data we have received that can also be edited with the button, which will send us to our EditExpensed page, we can also delete entrys from here.

Our AddExpense page give us the option to add data to our expense list using our routes.

I have made this front end as simple as i can.

I have created all pages of our app in the components folder and a Navbar connecting them all using routes in App.js

I did not add any folders for redux as Chris mentioned we don't need to and might be better if we avoid redux for tis project.

Hope we can use this to start with and make it look nicer once we get the functionality sorted in the backend repo - Andy
